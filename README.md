There were many commits due to poor file sorting - they weren't in order, so I had to delete the files and upload them again.

The session started and I got sick, and there were other unforeseen problems.
We're starting back after the New Year's weekend. I have exams coming up. I'm trying to pay more attention to the book
Chapter 12 will be in a different repository, because a mini-game is being created there, which I will add to the mini-projects
01/19/26 I'm a little sick, but I continue reading the book and writing code based on it.
